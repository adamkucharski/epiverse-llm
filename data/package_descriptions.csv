value,description
finalsize,finalsize is an R package to calculate the final size of a SIR epidemic in populations with heterogeneity in social contacts and infection susceptibility.
serofoi,"serofoi is an R package to estimate the Force-of-Infection (FoI) of a given pathogen from age-disaggregated population-based cross-sectional serosurveys, using a Bayesian framework. The package provides a set of features for assessing model fitting, convergence and visualisation."
epiparameter,epiparameter is an R package that contains a library of epidemiological parameters for infectious diseases and a set classes and helper functions to be able to work with the data. It also includes functions to extract and convert parameters from reported summary statistics.
superspreading,superspreading is an R package that provides a set of functions to estimate and understand individual-level variation in transmission from secondary cases.
linelist,"linelist provides a safe entry point to the Epiverse software ecosystem, adding a foundational layer through tagging, validation, and safeguarding epidemiological data, to help make data pipelines more straightforward and robust."
sivirep,"Current version of sivirep provides functions for data wrangling and automated reports based on linelist data from SIVIGILA, which is the official epidemiological surveillance system for Colombia, South America."
cleanepi,cleanepi provides functions to clean epidemiological data provided in the form of a data frame or other related data type.
datadelay,"datadelay is an R package to estimate disease severity and under-reporting in real-time, accounting for delays in epidemic time-series. datadelay provides simple, fast methods to calculate the overall or static case fatality ratio (CFR) of an outbreak up to a given time point, as well as how the CFR changes over the course of the outbreak. datadelay can help estimate disease under-reporting in real-time, accounting for delays reporting the outcomes of cases."
epiCo,"epiCo provides functions for clustering, regression, now casting, and sup reporting analyses vector-borne diseases in Colombia."
epidemics,"epidemics is an R package that provides a convenient interface to a library of compartmental models that can help to model epidemic scenarios for directly transmitted infections such as influenza, Covid-19, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The models in epidemics implement methods outlined in Bj¿rnstad et al. (2020a) and Bj¿rnstad et al. (2020b). The models in epidemics can help provide rough estimates of the course of epidemics, and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions."
epichains,"epichains is an R package to simulate, analyse, and visualize the size and length of branching processes with a given offspring distribution. These models are often used in infectious disease epidemiology, where the chains represent chains of transmission, and the offspring distribution represents the distribution of secondary infections caused by an infected individual."
readepi,readepi provides functions for importing data into R from files and common health information systems.
episoap,This package provides a store of curated outbreak analytics pipelines as rmarkdown reports.
